Distributed Fermat primality test for large finding prime numbers implemented in Clojure.

A server generates natural numbers to be tested and serves them to workers. The workers run
a Fermat primality test on them and announces the result to the server. The server then stores
the tested numbers in an sqlite database.

A ~hello world~ of distributed systems. Currently WIP. A browser client with a javascript worker to
be implemented.
